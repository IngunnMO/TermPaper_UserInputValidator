The UserInputValidator has two methods:

validate_positive_integers:
- Accepts a list of strings and checks for positive integers. 
- It collects all the positive integers in a result list which is returned when completed

display_message
- prints a success message once a validation has occurred.
- this method is private and is automatically instantiated when a validation has been completed.
